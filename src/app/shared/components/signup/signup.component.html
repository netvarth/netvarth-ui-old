            provides its services to registered service provider or registered consumer. The
            service of Jaldee is to provide a platform wherein registered service providers and
            registered consumers can interact and more effectively carry out their business.
            Jaldee in no manner guarantees any minimum quantum of business to any registered

          <li>On selecting to be registered as a service provider, by providing the mobile number,
            first and last name, domain and sub domain of service and accepting these terms and
            conditions, a one-time password will be sent to the provided mobile number.</li>
          <li>The action of requesting a one-time password by providing the above said information
            and opting to accept these terms and conditions would constitute voluntary
            acceptance of these terms and conditions as amended from time to time by Jaldee.
          </li>
          <li>The said mobile number would be treated as the registered mobile number of the
            registered service provider.</li>
          <li>On verifying the mobile number, the registered service provider will be permitted to
            set up a password and a detailed profile including name, email address, physical
            address, GPS location, hours of work, search tags etc. The information that can be
            included in the profile would depend on the type of license opted for by the
            registered service provider.</li>
          <li>The registered service provider shall provide true, accurate and complete
            information in the profile or on any other forms they fill on the platform. If it is
            found that any wrong/ misleading information is provided by the registered service
            provider, such registered service provider would become liable for termination and
            blacklisting as per the procedures contemplated under these terms and conditions and
            shall be liable for other legal action both under civil and criminal law.</li>
          <li>The registered service provider may choose to be granted any level of license. The
            continuance of the type of license opted would depend up on payment of the license
            fee. On expiry of term of paid license, the registered service provider would be
            reverted back automatically to the free basic license available as on the date of
            expiry of the earlier license. Any additional facility that was being used by the
            registered service provider by opting for a higher level of license would be
            truncated or cancelled as the case may be on such reversion to basic license.
            Payments made against License Packages are not refundable.</li>
          <li>By registering as a Registered Service Provider, the person so registering is making
            an express representation to Jaldee and also all Registered Consumers that he is
            eligible in accordance with law that may be in force to provide the domain or sub
            domain of service, or sub category of service, claimed to be provided by the said
            Registered Service Provider. Jaldee shall not be in any manner responsible for any
            untruthfulness, inaccuracy or incompleteness of such information. The Registered
            Service Provider is duty bound to disclose and update any information relevant or
            having any bearing on his capacity or eligibility to provide the service on the
            platform.</li>
          <li>By registering as a Registered Service Provider or as a Registered Consumer, the
            person so registering is expressly representing that the person is a legal entity or
            natural person eligible to enter into legally binding contracts. Jaldee shall not be
            held responsible for any misrepresentation or suppression in this regard.</li>
          <li>On registration, the Registered Service Provider or Registered Consumer shall be
            permitted to set up a password. The said Registered Service Provider/Consumer shall
            be solely and entirely responsible for the safeguard and confidentiality of the
            password and it is mutually agreed that Jaldee would be free to assume that any
            usage of the platform with the said password shall be usage by the Registered
            Service Provider/Consumer or by a person authorized by them. The Registered Service
            Provider/ Consumer shall notify Jaldee immediately on noting any unauthorized/
            suspicious use of the platform.</li>
          <li>Registered Service Provider shall not transfer his rights or obligations including
            the registration/account to any one without the express written permission of Jaldee
            and any agreement or arrangement to that effect shall be void. However, it is
            mutually agreed that Jaldee would be free to assign the rights and liabilities under

            for under Annexure 2 to these terms and conditions.</li>
          <li>The lowest level of verification would only involve verification of
            attested/certified copies of documents sent over to Jaldee by the registered service
            provider. This will be totally free. Higher levels of verification would be made on
            payment of verification fee and within such time as stipulated in Annexure 2.</li>
          <li>Till verification of the registered service provider as contemplated by opted level
            of verification is complete, the fact that the registered service provider is
            unverified would be displayed to the registered consumers. The level of verification
            and the manner in which verification is carried out would be displayed to the
            registered consumers once the verification is complete.</li>
          <li>If the basic verification required for minimum level of verification is not complete
            within 15 (fifteen) days from the date of registration, Jaldee may in its discretion
            cancel the basic registration of the registered service provider.</li>
          <li>The verification would need renewal as per time period provided for each level of
            verification in Annexure 2 on payment of fee as prescribed in Annexure 2. If the
            renewal is not done within the time frame, the registration would be reverted to
            basic verification, or the basic registration itself may be cancelled as may be
            necessary.</li>

            independent and Jaldee will have no role to play in the same except to the extent of
            dispute resolution system provided under these terms and conditions.</li>
          <li>The liability for tax of any kind including Goods and Service Tax for the service
            provided by the Registered Service Provider shall be solely and entirely the

            available for the registered consumers conducting a search for any service related
            to the domain or sub domain of service provided by the registered service provider.
          </li>
          <li>The order of listing on search would be determined based on level of verification
            and proximity from the location of the consumer, of the registered service provider.

          <li>The registered service provider hereby expressly authorises Jaldee to display and

            queue position on an available date with the registered service provider.</li>
          <li>The registered service provider may cancel any queue position. The registered
            service provider may delay the time window for the queue position. The registered
            consumers concerned would then be notified of the cancellation or delay on the
            platform.</li>

            provider concerned, the same would be considered in accordance with the dispute
            resolution system.</li>
          <li>The queue system would be allotting slots of time based on either the pre-set time
            windows provided by the service provider or based on the time window calculated by
            Jaldee relying on the machine learning algorithm. If the waiting time relying on
            machine learning algorithm is used it may result in inaccuracy as the same is

        <strong>Jaldee pay system (applicable if you use Jaldee pay)</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Jaldee pay is an additional facility enabling a service provider to accept payment
            through the jaldee app.</li>
          <li>The service provider may at his option based on his level of registration provide
            the bank account no. and such other details necessary while registering the jaldee
            account. If such details are provided the jaldee pay system would enable the jaldee
            provider to accept payment directly into his account using the gateway provided in
            the application for the same.</li>
          <li>In case the service provider does not opt for giving the a/c credentials, a separate
            account would be maintained by jaldee for the purpose of crediting money in favor of
            the service provider through the jaldee app. In such circumstances the following
            terms and conditions would be applicable for the payment made through jaldee app.
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>A percentage of payments made by consumer would be retained as payment
                commission by jaldee depending on the level of registration of the Service
                Provider.</li>
              <li>The balance amount after such commission would be held in the credit of the
                service provider by jaldee as a trustee.</li>
              <li>The amount standing to the credit of the service provider would be paid
                every week through the method chosen by the service provider at the time of
                registration. The service provider may opt for physical delivery of a cheque
                or for any online transfer of the amount as the case may be.</li>
              <li>The jaldee will not be paying any interest on the amount standing to the
                credit of the service provider. If the payment due to the service provider
                is delayed for a period of more than 3 months, the payment would be made by
                jaldee along with interest at the rate of 4% per annum from the date of
                completion of 3 months from the date of credit.</li>

        <strong>Dispute resolution system</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Jaldee will provide on its platform a method for both registered service providers
            and the registered consumers to raise a complaint or dispute against the other in
            respect of any queue position booked through Jaldee within 48 hours from the time of
            completion of the service.</li>
          <li>Jaldee will consider the said complaint through its dispute resolution council with
            reasonable opportunity to both parties. The decision of the council shall be final.
          </li>
          <li>The Dispute resolution system provided by Jaldee does not in any manner cover a
            claim or complaint in respect of the quality of the service provided by the
            Registered Service Provider and it shall only cover the honouring of queue position
            by the Registered Service Provider. Any claim a Registered Consumer may have against
            a Registered Service Provider in respect of any deficiency in service offered will
            have to be taken up with the appropriate legal authority based on the contract
            between the Registered Consumer and Registered Service Provider.</li>

        <strong>Removal and black listing</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>If on verification, or complaint or by any other means Jaldee comes to realise that
            the registered service provider has provided false, inaccurate, incomplete,
            misleading, or fraudulent information on the platform, Jaldee may in its discretion
            remove the registration of the registered service provider and /or blacklist the
            registered service provider, thus preventing such registered service provider from
            again registering on the platform.</li>
          <li>The registered service provider shall honour any queue position fixed through the
            platform. In case of any disability to honour such queue position the registered
            service provider shall cancel/ delay the queue position sufficiently in advance so
            as to avoid any inconvenience to the concerned registered consumer. Any default in
            such best communication policy shall be treated as misuse of the platform.
            Consistent /repeated misuse of the platform which may give rise to complaints from
            the registered consumers would result in removal /blacklisting of the registered
            service provider at the discretion of Jaldee.</li>
          <li>Jaldee is also providing a facility to interact through chat between registered
            service provider and registered consumer. The users shall ensure decency in language
            on such platform. Any violation of the same may result in removal/blacklisting of
            the person concerned.</li>
          <li>The platform is intended only to be used for registered service providers and
            registered consumers to interact in respect of their business, book and confirm
            queue position and to enable payment for service. Use of the platform for any other
            purpose by a registered service provider or a registered consumer shall be treated
            as an abuse of the platform which may, at the discretion of Jaldee, result in
            removal or blacklisting of the registered service provider or registered consumer.
          </li>
          <li>If any Registered Service Provider fails to comply with these terms and conditions
            or violates the same, Jaldee may in its discretion remove or blacklist the said
            Registered Service Provider.</li>
          <li>The details of removed/blacklisted registered service provider would be disclosed/
            displayed to registered consumers by Jaldee and the registered service providers by
            accepting these terms and conditions expressly authorised Jaldee to do so.</li>
          <li>The actions mentioned above which may result in removal /blacklisting would also
            make the registered service provider/ registered consumer for being subjected to
            legal action both under civil and criminal law. The removal /blacklisting as the
            case may be would be without prejudice to such legal action Jaldee may take.</li>
          <li>If Jaldee is convinced that there exists a prima face case for removal
            /blacklisting, Jaldee may choose to suspend the registration of the registered
            service provider pending final decision on the question of removal/blacklisting.
          </li>
          <li>If a registered service provider who has a paid level of license is either removed
            or blacklisted, the entire fee for the licence paid to Jaldee would stand forfeited
            and the registered service provider shall not be entitled to any kind of
