Consumers should check the refund policy with the respective service providers or businesses by phone or other means before making any payments. All Refund requests will be processed by the respective service providers and businesses and hence should be directly sent to the service provider or business. When service providers or businesses issue refunds, the refund amount may be less from the original amount by the following transaction fees. All the payments are done directly to the provider. So in any refund case it is service providerâ€™s responsibility to refund the payments done by the consumer. Jaldee does not claim to make any refunds. In case of there being any technical failure, at the time of transaction and there is a problem in making payment, you could contact support@jaldee.com
