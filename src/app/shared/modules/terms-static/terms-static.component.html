                                    truncated or cancelled as the case may be on such reversion to basic license.

                                <li>Registered consumer may cancel the queue position and, on such cancelation, the

                                <li>The queue system would be allotting slots of time based on either the pre-set time
                                    windows provided by the service provider or based on the time window calculated by
                                    Jaldee relying on the machine learning algorithm. If the waiting time relying on
                                    machine learning algorithm is used it may result in inaccuracy as the same is
                                    calculated in accordance with the history of time consumed in each consumer’s case
                                    by the service provider. Jaldee would not be held responsible for any kind of damage
                                    that may occur due to adherence to automatically generated time windows based on
