                        <span>Queues simply means the active time of the business. One can add
                            multiple
                            Working
                            Hours
                            according to the business schedule. To understand this with an example,
                            suppose a
                            business
                            works
                            from Monday to Friday (9 am to 5 pm) whereas, on Weekends (i.e. Saturday and
                            Sunday), it
                            operates only for 4 hours (9 am to 1 pm). In such cases, one can create two
                            working
                            hours,
                            one
                            for weekdays and the other one for the Weekends.</span>

                                check-ins list in the dashboard.The steps you take in the Custom Fields/Labels option from
                                provider dashboard, create the label and make it available for use from the check-ins list
                                in the dashboard. And also you can use the New Label/Manage Label option from check-in list
                                in
                                dashboard to add new label or manage the existing labels.<br>
                                <strong>How to create a new lablel?</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To get started with creating new label click the button “ADD LABELS”.</li>
                                    <li>Input the label name and briefly describe the label you wish to add.</li>
                                    <li>Then click the button <strong>“Short label button”</strong> to add the values of the
                                        label which can be
                                        used to sort the check-ins list in the dashboard.</li>
                                    <li>Enter a value and a corresponding short value and click “ADD” to save.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>You can also delete the added values from here.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Click SAVE to save all the information.</li>
                                    <li>And once a label is created, when a particular check-in is selected from dashboard a
                                        label
                                        symbol appears in right corner , click that symbol and assign a particular value to
                                        this

                                </ul>
                                <strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> A provider creates a label named <strong>“Check-ins”</strong> and
                                describing this label as “Both walk-in and online check-ins”. Then he clicks <strong>“Short
                                    label button”</strong>.First he entered a value “Walk-in” and gave a shortcut value “W”,
                                again he added the second value “Online”and gave shortcut value “O”. Now from the check-ins
                                list in the dashboard, provider chooses the label for each check-in using that symbol appeared in the right corner of the selected check-in and
                                assign respective values according to the type of check-in that customer has taken ie;
                                either
                                <strong>W</strong>(walk-in)or <strong>O</strong>(Online).
