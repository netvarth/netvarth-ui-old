              spoken to a staff member at your organization. In case you don’t want to be listed please mail us on
              support@jaldee.com or call us on 0487-2325650 and we will have one of our senior team members speak to you
              and explain. If you still want to go ahead and delist please let the team member know when they speak to
              you and we will delist you immediately.
